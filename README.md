# Multiple Program Multiple Data (MPMD) programming with MPI

This contrains fortran example codes for MPMD programming with MPI. Four example cases with MPI implementations are provided. 

1. Communicatior split with MPI_Comm_split function


2. Process spawn with MPI_Comm_spawn function

3. Process spawn with MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple function and communicatior split with MPI_Comm_split function

4. Process spawn with MPI_Comm_spawn function and inter-communicator creation between spawned processes
